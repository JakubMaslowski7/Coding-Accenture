%Question 1a

%The 5 fundamental components of the computer covered in the lecture are:
%Processor, Main Memory, Hard Disk, Input/Output Devices, and BUS-Wires.

%Question 1b

%Processor - performs all mathematical operations and runs programs
%Main memory - store all information that the computer is currently using
%Hard disk - stores information when computer is switched off
%BUS-Wires - connects and transfers information between the processor, memory and storage
%Input/Output devices - allow information/data to be put into and out of the computer

%Question 1c

%it takes more time to get information from a hard disk than from the
%computers main memory because on a hard disk, the files are stored on a
%rotating disk and for the computer to read the files, the head must
%physically move, this takes much longer than the main memory as this only
%stores the information that is currently being used, so it takes much less
%time to go through all that information compared to all the information on
%a hard disk

%Question 1d

%Embedded computers I use: Gaming controller, coffee machine, speakers
